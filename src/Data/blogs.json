These crops are specifically bred or engineered to withstand the increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather conditions brought about by climate change. By harnessing advancements in agricultural science, researchers have been able to create crops that are more resilient to droughts, floods, and pests, thus ensuring a more stable food supply even in the face of environmental adversity."

It is estimated that approximately one-third of all food produced globally is either lost or wasted along the supply chain. This wastage not only squanders precious resources but also exacerbates food insecurity by depriving those in need of access to sustenance. Fortunately, initiatives aimed at reducing food waste are gaining traction worldwide. From improved storage and transportation methods to redistributing surplus food to those in need, concerted efforts are being made to minimize waste and ensure that food reaches its intended destination."
